            <p>
              This course explores interactive design. Emphasis will be placed on
              technical fundamentals of both User Experience (UX) and User
              Interface (UI) as well as concept development and the application of
              Graphic Design fundamentals. The primary medium for the course will
              be web design but the topics discussed translate to other
              interactive media, such as mobile apps, screen-based kiosks, and
              more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout each unit there will be readings, online tutorials,
              demos, and exercises that will provide overviews of the necessary
              skills/knowledge needed to succeed in this class. Critiques will
              serve as an opportunity for you and your peers to present your work
              and receive feedback for further fine tuning. The course will be a
              mix of instruction, usually via discussion or technical
              demonstrations and studio time, which is free time for you to work
              on your projects and receive closer attention from the instructor.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this studio we will concentrate on learning fundamental web
              design technologies: HyperText Markup Lanugage (HTML), Cascading
              Style Sheets (CSS), and more. There are a huge number of platforms
              and services available to you on the web today: OtherPeoplesPixels,
              WordPress, Wix, Squarespace… the list is very long. HTML and CSS
              are foundational, so no matter what additional web technologies you
              choose or what platforms come and go, they will always be in the
              equation. We will work with those tools to allow you maximum
              flexibility for the future.

            <p>
              No extra credit will be offered, but you may choose to revise and
              resubmit any project before the end of the semester to improve your
              score. (Notice this says re-vise and re-submit… you have to turn in

          <section class="section" id="grading">
            <h2 class="section-title">Grading</h2>
            <p>
              All projects will follow the grading system below. You receive a
              number for a series of project requirements: idea generation,
              degree of progress, depth of thinking, and following directions and
              craftsmanship. Your final grade is an average of those requirements
              for each project. If a project is worth 100 points total, each of
              the following five aspects of the project is worth 20 points.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Idea Generation:</strong> This is the first step in the
              design process. I am grading you on how you participate in the idea
              generating activities, if you came up with the requested amount of
              ideas, how well they answered the problem of the project, and how
              they developed into the final product. Idea generation is best
              documented by saving and including your process work when you turn
              in your project files.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Depth of Thinking:</strong> I am looking at how well you
              thought about the problem and the solutions you were suggesting.
              Did you do research? Did you look at other designs that inspired
              you? How is that reflected in your design solutions? Did you take
              the information you learned in critique and use that to develop
              your idea even further?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Visually Compelling:</strong> This is the quality of the
              final design. Does your solution to the design problem meet a level
              of professional standards in the field of graphic design? Did you
              spend the time developing your idea to the best of your ability?
              Does your composition utilize the fundamental principles of
              design?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Following Directions &amp; Craftsmanship:</strong> I am
              making sure that you followed all the specifications in the project
              brief. Is your project the correct size? Free from typos? Did you
              meet all the deadlines and is the final project completed on time?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Critique Participation:</strong> Here I am making sure that
              you participated in critiques. Critique is an essential part of
              design work, both for your own work and helping your colleagues
              improve their work. Did you comment on your colleagues’ work in a
              respectful, constructive way? Did you recieve feedback in a
              respectful, constructive way? Were you able to clearly articulate
              your ideas and rationalize your design choices when speaking about
              your work?

            <h2 class="section-title">About Critique</h2>
            <p>
              Critique is a time during class where we give useful input to
              improve the work of our peers. Whether any of us “like” the work
              from our classmates is irrelevant, so try to tailor your comments
              and suggestions to be as objective as possible. Key questions might
              include:
            </p>
            <ul class="item-list">
              <li><em><mark>“What is the work doing?”</mark></em></li>
              <li>
                <em><mark>“How is the work doing what it is doing?”</mark></em>
              </li>
              <li>
                <em><mark>“What do we think the designer’s intention might have been?”</mark></em>
              </li>
              <li>
                <em><mark>“What associations or references does the work call to mind?”</mark></em>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Each student is highly encouraged to practice being as specific as
              possible and avoid vague and subjective statements such as: “I
              like...” “I don’t like...” “_____ is good,” “_____ could be
              better,” etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              A final note on critique: it is better to present what you have at
              a project critique, even if incomplete, than to skip critique and
              not participate. You will always learn something from critique. If
              you are considering skipping critique because you feel unprepared,
              please contact me so I can help.
            </p>

          <section class="section" id="attendance">
            <h2 class="section-title">Class Attendance</h2>
            <p>
              Students are allowed three unexcused absences with no penalty. For
              each unexcused absence after that, the student’s final grade will
              be lowered by one +/- (in other words, an A becomes an A-, an A-
              becomes a B+, a B+ becomes a B, etc.). If a student reaches ten
              absences (excused or unexcused), they will automaticallyfail the
              course. If a student must miss a class due to a family, medical, or
              personal emergency, they should let the instructor know as soon as
              possible. Students must provide documentation for the cause of the
              absence for it to be excused.

              Email is the best way to contact me outside of class. When you send
              me an e-mail I sometimes only see your e-mail address. Your name is
              not always visible. So, when sending out an e-mail, please include
              your full name and your class section (i.e. Art 377, section 001.)

            <h2 class="section-title">Department Classroom Conduct Policy</h2>
            <p>
              The Department of Art &amp; Design expects conduct appropriate for a
              university classroom. We have no tolerance for disrespectful
              behavior, which includes but is not limited to private
              conversations with your classmates, surfing, playing games, looking
              at social media or e-mail during a lecture or demonstration, rude
              comments, and/or physical threats directed towards the instructor
              or your peers, and sleeping in class. Cell phones must also be
              silenced before class starts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your actions can result in a significant lowering of your final
              grade. The instructor reserves the right to pull you aside and talk
              to you individually, to have you removed from class, and to report
              you to the Dean of Students’ office.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cheating and plagiarism will not be tolerated and will be punished
              to the fullest extent of university policy. Each instructor also
              reserves the right to determine his or her own specific classroom
              conduct policies.

              inclusive learning and working environment for all students,

              all forms of discrimination and harassment are prohibited at our

              UW-Parkside seeks to uphold standards that promote respect and
              human dignity in an environment that fosters academic excellence
              and professionalism. Gender-based discrimination, pregnancy
              discrimination, relationship violence, and sexual misconduct, which
              includes harassment, assault, exploitation, and stalking, violate
              the university’s core values and policies and may also violate
              state and federal law. University faculty and staff are considered
              “Mandatory Reporters” and must report incidents of sexual
              misconduct and relationship violence for the safety of the
              individuals involved and the wider community. If you or someone you
              know has been impacted by sexual misconduct, relationship violence,
              gender-based discrimination, or needs support as a pregnant
              student, please visit the
